# NLP-Portfolio-Projects
Hello! This repository contains all the projects I did in Natural Language Processing

----

**Basic NLP Project:** This project implemented a complete workflow for acquiring, cleaning, and annotating text from an online article using Python, BeautifulSoup, spaCy, and pandas. The pipeline extracted content from a downloaded HTML file, removed noise, applied linguistic pre-processing, and organized the resulting annotations into a structured DataFrame. A custom tokenizer was also integrated to address date-splitting requirements not handled by spaCy’s default configuration.

--------

**Text Representation and Classification:** This project focuses on offensive language detection in social media posts.

-------

**Sequence Labeling for Quantity Recognition in Scientific Texts:** This project addresses the Quantity recognition step of the MeasEval shared task from SemEval-2021. The goal is to identify spans containing quantities (e.g., 12 kg) in scientific documents. The task is approached as a Sequence Labeling problem using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented with Keras and TensorFlow.

--------

**Pretrained Language Modules:** This repository contains implementations for all three subtasks of the ComVE shared task from SemEval-2020. The project focuses on evaluating whether systems can determine if a natural language statement makes sense and provide explanations.
