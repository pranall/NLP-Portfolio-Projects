        "The SubTask C project focused on fine-tuning a pre-trained BART model for sequence-to-sequence generation. The task required generating a valid reason explaining why a given statement did not make sense. For example, the statement \"He put an elephant into the fridge\" had three reference reasons: \"An elephant is much bigger than a fridge,\" \"A fridge is much smaller than an elephant,\" and \"Most of the fridges aren't large enough to contain an elephant.\"\n",

Fine-tuning utilized the Transformers library and the Hugging Face Hub, with experiments conducted on a reduced dataset and the base BART model. Full-scale training required GPU or TPU resources due to computational demands."
