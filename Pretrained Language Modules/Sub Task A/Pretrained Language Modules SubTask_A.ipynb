The task is treated as a text-matching classification problem: the model receives a pair of statements and outputs the index of the illogical one. For example, between the pair “He put a turkey into the fridge” and “He put an elephant into the fridge,” the second statement is the nonsensical one.\n",

Colab provides a Jupyter-based interface with optional GPU and TPU acceleration suitable for fine-tuning large language models.

When `shrink_dataset` and `base_model` are set to `True`, the model only partially learns the task, yielding an expected accuracy of approximately 0.49. A full training run, with both variables set to `False`, achieves an accuracy of around 0.929."
